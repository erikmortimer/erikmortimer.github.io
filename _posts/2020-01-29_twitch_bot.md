excerpt:  How I created my own twitch bot for my channel and how it helps me run my stream
---
I have always wanted to try this "live streaming" thing out for a while now. After a couple of tries over the years, I am now trying to stream consistently on the platform and have been for a couple weeks now. Since I am mainly going to be streaming my programming session and also talk tech, I needed to brainstorm personal projects for me to do on stream. And with that, I decided to create my own twitch bot for my twitch stream called "SnowForgeBot".

- Talk about the features that I want in the bot and the I wanted
- What library did I use: IRC
- Why did I use Python over Javascript
- Put link to the github repo 
- Might want to add a photo of the raspberry pi thats running the bot

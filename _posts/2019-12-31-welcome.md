# Hello there :wave:
Hello and welcome to my development blog. My name is Erik Mortimer, computer science undergrad student, passionate about technology and software, music nerd, coffee addict, and etc. just to mention a couple of things. My goal of this blog is to share what personal projects I am working on at the time and the knowledge/experience I have in this space. 

Thanks for stopping on by and I'll be back with more posts!
